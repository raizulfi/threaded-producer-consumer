# Threaded Producer-Consumer Program

The program will generate three output files:
- `all.txt`: Contains all the generated numbers.
- `even.txt`: Contains only the even numbers.
- `odd.txt`: Contains only the odd numbers.

It will be found in `output_files` directory and the code reset after every rerun. This can be removed, only for simplicity's sake.
