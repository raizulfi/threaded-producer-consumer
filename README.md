# Threaded Producer-Consumer Program

This is a Python program demonstrating a multi-threaded implementation of the producer-consumer pattern. The program generates random integers and inserts them into a bounded buffer using one producer thread and consumes the numbers from the buffer using two consumer threads.

The program will generate three output files:
- `all.txt`: Contains all the generated numbers.
- `even.txt`: Contains only the even numbers.
- `odd.txt`: Contains only the odd numbers.
